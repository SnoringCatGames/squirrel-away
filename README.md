# Squirrel Away

> _**[Live demo](https://levi.dev/squirrel)**_

This simple game showcases procedural pathfinding across 2D-platformer surfaces using the [Surfacer](https://github.com/snoringcatgames/surfacer/) framework.

In this game, the user can click anywhere in the level, and the cat character will then jump, walk, and climb across platforms in order to reach that target destination.
